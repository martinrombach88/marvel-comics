Intermediate Concepts

- Entity Framework
(API Course -> Mosh's course)

Repository Flow / Repository Pattern (API and Mosh):
Goal is to create a generic type of 'model' that gets passed in as an argument to an endpoint. (true?)

- reusable, minimises duplicate query logic
- decouples your application from a persistence framework (e.g. EF, in case you need to change)
- promotes testing
