API, HTTP calls to a database

A frontend that searches for olympics information
125 years of summer olympics
Interface between the db and the api with an orm (i.e. entity framework)

Slices of Data:
Year
Athlete
Location
Sport

Focus on DB

Entity, MS SQL .NET, IIS, React or Blazor, Use Third Normal Form
Maybe you should do entity and swagger?

can you do everything local? how would you play with azure / automation?
don't worry -> key is classes and tests anyway

What's next:

set up database

console app for testing is fine for now, move into unit tests long term
