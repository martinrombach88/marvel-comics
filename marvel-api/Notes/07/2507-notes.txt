Just a quick reminder for MacOS and Linux students:
In the next lecture, and lectures to come, we will be using "Windows Authentication" in the video, but this will only work on Windows OS.
Please continue to use SQL Authentication and provide a Username and Password that we used in the install video instead.

If you used the same credentials as me in the install video, they will be as follows:
UserName: sa
Password: SQLConnect1

For connection strings you will also need to set Trusted_Connection to false and supply a UserName and Password:
Server=localhost;Database=DotNetCourseDatabase;Trusted_Connection=false;TrustServerCertificate=True;User Id=sa;Password=SQLConnect1;

Thank You, and I will see you in the next lecture!

Data Contexts ->
You should have both the dapper and entity framework approaches.
You should also try olympics 2 with a code first approach that maps the tables from the code.
