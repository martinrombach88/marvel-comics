1. goal - use db first approach with EF and get any data from the db

- get date call first
X -> EF doesn't really work like that.
How to test?
Simple GET would be best.

Did:
Matched the code for model, controller, data context
Error:
500 + Data is null (get date time)

publish date is a DateTime value.
how do you work with dates in ef?

Is this issue to do with the date or the connection in general?

Solution ->
DateTime isn't nullable. using DateTime? makes the value nullable.
Then I needed to make a sample table as the original table was too big.

Dad - to 'normalise' the data and separate it out, 
you will need a character table to compare the comics to.
Use the Marvel API to generate a list and make a table from the 
list called Characters.
Use it to generate single and multiple endpoints where comics 
are returned containing the search. 

2. character endpoint
3. teamup endpoint
